# Car-Price-Prediction-
## Overview

This project aims to help a Chinese automobile company understand the pricing dynamics in the American car market by building machine learning models to predict car prices. By identifying the most significant variables and training accurate models, the company can design cars and pricing strategies suited for the US market.

## Business Goal

- Determine the *key variables* that influence car prices.
- Build predictive models to estimate car prices based on these variables.
- Help the company tailor its car design and pricing strategy for the US market.

## Models Implemented

The following regression algorithms were used:

1. *Linear Regression*
2. *Decision Tree Regressor*
3. *Random Forest Regressor*
4. *Gradient Boosting Regressor*
5. *Support Vector Regressor (SVR)*

Each model was trained on the same dataset and evaluated using standard regression metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated on the test set using:

- *R² (R-squared)* — Proportion of variance explained
- *MSE (Mean Squared Error)* — Penalizes large errors
- *MAE (Mean Absolute Error)* — Average of all absolute errors
